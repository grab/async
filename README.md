# go-concurrency

This library aims to provide useful utilities on top of the built-in concurrency supports from Go with exhaustive unit 
tests and benchmark suites. Each package in this repo represents a different feature.

Clients can take a look at the `README.md` from each package to understand what it's meant for.

## Guidelines for contributing

Contributions are highly welcome! In order for a contribution to be merged, please follow these guidelines:
- Open an issue and describe what you're offering (e.g. fixing a bug, adding an enhancement, etc.).
- Submit a pull request with clear description of the changes and a link to the above issue after getting feedbacks
  from the core team.
- New code must have unit tests and, if required by the core team, benchmark tests.
- If the new code aims to fix performance issues, you must include benchmarks in the process (either in the issue or
  in the pull request).
- In general, we'd like to keep our code as simple and as similar as possible to the native Go. Please keep this in
  mind when opening issues.
